are you asleep
or are you
are you awake
nah man im done
im showered im everything
ate some fuckin lucky charms
lets go
most copious
rains soaked the opiates
notice how the phobias appropriately procreate
woke up with a ghost farm
focused on his groceries
when they arent telling stories they are multiplying grossly
on the lawn
let em loiter never let em spawn
the apparitions have been drinking his water for too long
so when they gathered by the birdbath in the morning he would tell em
i mean no disrespect but you have all outstayed your welcome
interesting in a sense
interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence
how quickly they will lift their heads
and breathe an ultimatum like the dead dont argue
said youre living by the bayonet but how alive are you
shit a is all juice and bad etiquette
elbows on the table
lobster bibbin on the ready set
he said but how alive
i dunno homie you decide
no you decide fine
how alive too alive
how alive too alive
how alive too alive
and one by one around the yard til each one felt communal pride
like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public
with a steaming plate of justice for them easy baker stomachs say what
we the legends that hunt with the unremembered
geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor
who snuck around the art police and all related governments
to infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip
ahh moneys in the market for a mothership
to double as a vessel that drag his legacy under it
and who am i to hang him out to dry by the heat
when if rehydrating fails were all dumber because of me
zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
the too alive channel from the library of rivalry
and summers in the mud mud
winters by the tracks tracks
no story goes untold
aes is back
i got a handful rockin the same poker face
down to dance around the table like they own the place
you look like youve seen a ghost
i got the whole world thinkin its a holiday
cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away
you look like youve seen a ghost
