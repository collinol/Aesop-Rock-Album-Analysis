this is my friend tony
hes pretty cool although hes not always so smart
and then they were eight
just like that just like that
bring back pluto back back pluto
back back pluto plu plu pluto
in the beginning it was large marge sent me im bent
empty the rent if you can double park the garbage barge gently
the moon took a second mortgage on the seventh house
and jupiter aint talk to mars he felt the host of rovers sold him out
close your mouth poke your snout over the cloaked aroma clouds
solar boy elope with couch ogling older polaroids
motor mouth chauffeur the golden molar toy
gophers yoke a fish out of water he grows lungs and multiplies
idle when soldering a perfect union
it is vital to calculate any ornery loose ends
so if mutiny ensues the aloof is assumed nuisance
the clue is in his vacancy the proof is in his goosebumps
maroon the traitors expecting acres of edelweiss
who later learn it may actually be safer to play with knives
i show up late looking project grizzly
two bowies a third for throwing and accomplish dickweed
nothing nada nill i stuff a lot of pill to gut
whats the proper rules on stuffing hostages in trucks
ill be numb enough to chill before the choppers spill the blood
but if im not
fuck it plug him warpy got his goddamned groove back
jet setting on spec with a dead yeti on the roof rack
and miscreants will rubberneck jalopy euthanasia
which will later be regretted when its your turn for cremation
and i walk like early man freak a little witch hunt
gathering the carnies and exploiting every stigma
the malformed oddities among sovereigntys normal
shall abuse every vice you can imagine right before you
all i thought of was the cloven hooved
and how they clip clip clop over the woven roofs
with a nose for commotion and stolen goods
now tell me what the fuck am i supposed to do
in the mean time nine minus one left eight
in the mean time nine minus one left eight
in the mean time nine minus one left eight
we were busy putting barbs on a large iron gate
mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune
bring back pluto back back pluto
back back pluto plu plu pluto
theyre all theyre gonna want his milk money next
stare into the glowing eye of cerberus and crow
authoritative laminates will not repel the quarantined alone
all the town sickly know the coke machine as home
where they sit and hope the ovaltine that nobles drink is strong
couples only roller rink with soul to kiss your chicken noodle
before they wiggle mittens through the pillory to ridicule
and you can hear the iron maidens lock
or see the town criers ankle stock chained up to the tanker truck
a is up early ring and run thank you much
document a little of that underbelly bang for buck
hey i walk as the hype of the city gossip
meaning every dumpster divers gotta vomit up a comment like
um you aint shit this aint ill
this is little russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still
this a corpse full of pills trying to sit still and build
cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell
babylon goggles gawk for the galvatron coppers
tugboat salvage all fossils
ill be shepherd when the whirlybirds deny the lepers doctors
if im not fuck it
the terrible metal hacking seasonss as american as ski up off a plastic d cup
youd think charlie brown was weathermen
how i zig zag around these yellow backs for peanuts
in the baggy stomach lining attached to the bums in hiding sits the morals
every outing would slide to refine his grinding
when the freakishly disfigured have been triggered to surround you
you will live inside the actual second they let the hounds loose
mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune
bring back pluto back back back
pluto pluto bring back pluto
mercury venus earth mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune
bring back pluto back back pluto
