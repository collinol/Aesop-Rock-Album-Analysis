i stood before the glittery borders of new radius
in search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet
what i found was a gutter where the love of entertainment
meets the lust for blood and demerits
cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky
collar pop jolly roger die motherfucker die
apache on a ship shape in bristol fashion
snuck a jammy through the red tape and tiptoed past him
worm teeth grinding feverishly below
as little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow
so when its blackhawk over the glass walk
they surface up through the cash crops
with clippers for your belly up mascots and never dine alone
meanwhile back at sea level it was home by home zone for zone
bloom countys homeless riot for home ownership
i hope you put gas in the motor home and know the roads
i studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb
as opposed to the loaded nose who pray armageddon is numb
and thats unevenly rendered
to those who grew up thinking faith was a surrender of reason
but not a reason to surrender
catch the liberty fires catalog
forty torched orchids and citronella for algernon
don and vagabond alike repent
this shit should have been beta burns babylon the end
and when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors
to murder the medium that shot em thirty years before
they said
kill television
kill television
kill television
difficult isnt it
and when the cutters of the pie throw their summers in the sky
no love lost baby the future is so bright
kill television
kill television
kill television
difficult isnt it
nothing says charm like an armored car
taking the clone farm tards to the arms bazaar
we were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts
and march through the gauntlet of car alarms
no harps no delusions of losing with something prettier
than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears
but we can run with scissors through the city fair
or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs
double park the shuttle some will arc the funneled cutty sark
where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy clarks
these are the vices of the p noid bastards
who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest
but crews lose lunches by the hundreds
lose electricity lose gas phone plumbing
humming keep your mouth closed
keep your cows cloned go
i am the pulse of this fucking town homes know
my what a convenient embargo
at least ill always know which side of the gun im supposed to buy the farm from
the too far gone kicks still in the box
fix still in the pill in his sock
chilling gill in the slop and a million watch gideon scribes
but once the arc honor pussy and bribes the animals will divide
and thats a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish
while profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes
the mobile infantry is so postal
coast into the quotient provoking the local pistol pete
choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens
smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co dependencies
dopey no surrender bender in effect
sole defenders of the longest night new york had never slept
and there were jumping jacks and whistlers over christmas
like rockets from the crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference
i step in hog heaven stony with no weapons
pissing on teleprompters selling megaphones to hecklers
who broadcast eighty million versions of the sermon
for that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains
pale arcadian moon high definition flat plasma
imax city wide transfer
artificial einstein rosen out the tenement
ease into the xanadu let it hammer the tension out
im talking cool calm dominant phenomenal
monitor face to the wall opposite
ufos and locusts sing the same old song
while the weathermen get retarded as the day is long
