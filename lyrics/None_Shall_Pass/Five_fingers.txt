take take the medicine tastes great
got the key to the city im wake baked
way before the media shitting or 12 zip of ganked paint
the origin of a thievery leader will take place
two coke bottles adorn the rogue toddler
grapple a refrigerator gaffle a nilla wafer
and no role model provoke him to shift focus
cause he noticed that a cookie tastes better when its stolen
kids got the darnedest quirks
so 11s arms skip jars for his mommas purse
and bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn
which he kept in a box in the yard
and the bark isnt carved from a klepto anthem
but a klepto tangent prefaced the grand canvas
dance to the dirge stand up
celebrate the natural need to own what aint earned
see it rolls off the tongue
like a smoke ring rolls off a lung til its done
ready set kept petty theft on a post it
later apply the motives to a moment on some grown shit
hey you with the sharpie and bm
did you foreplay the gm or you carpe the diem
whore play the porn game fornicate the sure way to freedom
or correlate with the swordplay and heathens
trickery and backtalk fresh outta high school
on the prickly catwalk of the modern grind slide rule
every last number in its history
got is own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory
thanks bathe in a bottle of your finest
tackleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds
before the hell appears to put the chemi in the climate
get your money from the richest get your pussy from the flyest
slow and low do or die calm suicide king in the tuck of the palm
slow and low do or die stuck two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk
and these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
and these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
and these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
capture the flag
capture the flag
capture the flag
one by one like little confused penguins
larcenys yes men ooze for used weapons
like a bitter little burglar jaded up out the bucket seat
is dumb enough to feel like the public owe him a fucking thing
nope gotta configure the five finger
so the hot wired vehicular skill is applicable
if an eyes on the prize and the itch aint flushed
i hope the fruits of your labor outlive the initial rush like
step on the abysmal cusp
with matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fuck
then incubate the mutt baby through his stigmas crutch
like he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums
and this is certified milk by the new york department of skullduggery
shoplift quicker than your shutter speed click
missed he dipped with dumb cutlery
in and out of muddy river water til the rudder bleed
skip around the money pillar color me bunny killer
hovering where the mother feed gutter greed king
and a crummy motherfucker breed fuck with me
it go knock knock rummy at a bruckner speed
the seeds all growns up playing grown people games
evil aims grown encompass the whole steeple chase
grip mitigate the master plan
so when the workers are asleep riffraff expands
yes a pig is a cop but gotta fill up the flock
so when i rake in the bacon i hope the kiddiesll watch
i hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked
cause opportunitys fickle after it trickle it stop
capture the flag drag that crass little bastard
flat through the hazmat and glass
laugh when he ask for it back scratch that
welcome to the magic in a basket of cash
slow and low do or die calm suicide king in the tuck of the palm
slow and low do or die stuck two to five cans in the tuck of the trunk
and these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
and these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
and these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
