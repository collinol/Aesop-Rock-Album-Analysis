limped up like a dog with three legs shut up to the stage
so many dark arts to choose
you can focus to the phobias involved in forty hues
whether you levitate or bend spoons
tune into the prudence of the
dark heart news
breathins a tug of war
wet when i rush the ball
flushed 29 bust gum stuck
clutch the door
slumped in the back burn bush by the son of george
sweat tear and feed
cause i dont bleed when i cut no more
a system of gods
from each of the brawling tribes
so my bible is a pot of qualms clipped and collaged
pavlovs bad dogs parry mass bells
i dont speak the language but my last laughs held
spiraled get vertigo
signals the flash and beep
postin my head for myself to get back to me
pouch full of dynamite
blast cap anatomy
bags full of smelling salts
mad as the magazine attack
medic stretcher call
cracked crazy header fall
a threat a break a mistake with a pulse
pickin every last fuckin piece of paint off the walls
okay the rotary corner
grow to be notably mobile
and social gopher teeth form holes
or any scene where brie is normal
well locate every exit had seconds to flee the wormhole
when emergency diversions ring the celly or the door bell
burning it at both ends
friends lets commiserate
turn it into something to the sound that the triggers make
born at the baddest sign
half this time still awake
training all my zeros to perform like theyre figure eights

ey four corners of the globe all invent fire on the very same day in the very same cold
each sent a man with torch to the border line to boast
watch them collide and explode
when i peel the blinds back
up jump the irons call
monkey wrench in my hands
razor cut the islands off
homemade taps memories
i ignore the private calls
and ever since the 80s
i think somethings in my tylenols
what plague
make an idolant brigade
so eager to walk planks
they will climb a tree and wait
their irony is waning over piety and faith
so when the ghostly ruminations come
well kindly disobey it
i will live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint
to see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks
cant hold howls in corrals with a key
so will the worms please shriek on the count of three
three
if i had a dollar
for every time i couldnt sleep
i could buy a million locks
and finally read a book in peace
no more would my president come off as a crooked thief
and turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me
sideways eye on a sinister boundary
panel of contemporaries killing me loudly
99 models of fear on the wall timorous
done running into to the car on the wrong cinder blocks
