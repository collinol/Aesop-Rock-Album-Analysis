ayo ayo i send this to all of my corporate corpses
tryna abort the thoughts of comin out wildin
dumbin out time to off the office
i was surely sorta twisted
worked at a tv studio an audio assistant
easy do my duty though at times was in a mean mood
hot i gotta be cool
i was on the brink of fiends drool
glaring at the green room
made a brother the same color but beyond neon
pushin me to peon barkin at dreams to be gone
tending to the talent and many they havent any
was especially a challenge when he be like
goddamnit can he hear his vocal
as he cuffin it how my mic sound
thinkin on the low its perfect when he put the mic down
clown stand steady grillin wanting subservience
sound man buryin thinkin id fuckin murder them
and steamin as im watchin duke
leavin on some hot pursuit
gotta win as these cats be modelin what not to do
in a getaway car geta getaway car
in a getaway car car car car car
in a getaway car geta getaway car
in a getaway car car car car car car
six in the morning and the walls close in
high noon calls and the walls own him
kings at the ready know the walls wont win
storms on the harbor like a harbinger of gore right
gore is my harbinger pardon the art of war right
get your doors darkened
by the house of card carpenters
who never thought a slave could be a spartacus and more
pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
who take important conference calls in corner office walls
still a buck is a buck and he punch numbers
five   punch
just say no to company functions
and he duck into the dungeons
nothing says kill it like a day of fetching
paper clips and staplers for the privileged
two lives one is chores for whores
one is where i wanna be when you begin regretting yours
and i poured in with a large coffee
tardy every morning
to a man who took authority beyond what it was for
how you gonna pay the rent day job free
make rap records matter of fact thanks peace
in a getaway car geta getaway car
in a getaway car car car car car
in a getaway car geta getaway car
in a getaway car car car car car car
six in the morning and the walls close in
high noon calls and the walls own him
kings at the ready know the walls wont win
in a hospital gown day off from being tied down in recreation
swinging a paddle at mental patients
raping the competition to smother the pain and sin
so he pound you out in table tennis like wang liqin
too strange within just to stop
demented interactions sleep and thoughts documented
hes lingering insane paint thinner in his vein
colors blown out around the doctors finger in his brain
with a needle unable to beat him in a fetal position
he crafted a path to escape his condition
would cling to the white walls of psych halls
in his mind soon bled the words he would speak to the world in time
but not before more injections strapped to the bed
till the psychotropics took hold of the rap in his head
when his wrists released he wrote tunes you could snoop through
day of release said depart from me i never knew you
in a getaway car geta getaway car
in a getaway car car car car car
in a getaway car geta getaway car
in a getaway car car car car car car
six in the morning and the walls close in
high noon calls and the walls own him
kings at the ready know the walls wont win
