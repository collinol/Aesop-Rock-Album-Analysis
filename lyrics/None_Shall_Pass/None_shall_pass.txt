flash that buttery gold
jittery zeitgeist wither by the watering hole what a patrol
what are we to heart huckabee art fuckery suddenly
not enough young in his lung for the water wings
colorfully vulgar poacher out of mulch
like ima pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt
fine sign of the time we elapse
when a primate climb up a spine and attach
eye for an eye by the bog life swamps and vines
they get a rise out of frogs and flies
so when a dogfights hog tied prize sort of costs a life
the mouths water on a fork and knife
and the allure isnt right
no score on a war torn beach
where the cash cows actually beef
blood turns wine when it leak for police
like thats not a riot its a feast lets eat
and i will remember your name and face
on the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
and i will rejoice in your fall from grace
with a cane to the sky like none shall pass
none shall pass none shall pass
now if you never had a day a snow cone couldnt fix
you wouldnt relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
how he spoke through a nodoz motor on the fritz
cause he wouldnt play rollover fetch like a bitch
and express no regrets though he isnt worth a homeowners piss
to the jokers who pose by the glitz
fine sign of the swine in the swarm
when a king is a whore who comply and conform
miles outside of the eye of the storm
with a siphon to lure out a prize and award
while avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
true blue triumph is more
like wait let him snake up out of the centerfold
let it break the walls of jericho ready go
sat where the old cardboard city folk
swap tales with heads like every other penny throw
and i will remember your name and face
on the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
and i will rejoice in your fall from grace
with a cane to the sky like none shall pass
none shall pass none shall pass
you tried you tried you tried to trick me
youve got a youve youve got a a lot of nerve
im im not im not trying to trick you
im try im try im trying to help
okay woke to a grocery list goes like this
duty and death anyone object come stand in the way
you could be my little snake river canyon today
and i ran with a chain of commands
and a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
fine sign of the vibe in the crowd
when i cut a belly open to find what climb out
thats quite a bit of gusto he muster up
to make a dark horse rush like enoughs enough
it mustve struck a nerve so they huff and puff
til all the kings men fluster and clusterfuck
and its a beautiful thing
to my people who keep an impressive wingspan
even when the cubicle shrink
you got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
ny chew through the machine
and i will remember your name and face
on the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
and i will rejoice in your fall from grace
with a cane to the sky like none shall pass
none shall pass none shall pass
