before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops
high noon was your basic whos who of brutal truth
hot summer gun or box cutter slow dance
turn a youngn to a dozen paper dolls holding hands
and tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch
so chicanery was yours to engage or ignore
i was on the latter but a lot adopt pawns
so we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn
pass the popcorn brawl fair cop car
voyeur hawk him out his hinges storm door splinters
clamoring about hammers out about to ring
infiltrate each others tribes and murder each others queens
packed to the very last rafter
clung to the rafts and the cameras to capture the damage
neck swivel with a chop chop volley
where the ants leave nothing but the bones and the car keys
pardon if his two feet fester it was rude of me people meet left and lefter
planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector
but never got his extra extra
peace for the better but it wasnt entertaining
so they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven
like bees to the honey when they lumped you up
cause bumper cars are only funny when they bump
know that
hot summer gun or box cutter slow dance  popcorn popcorn
hot summer gun or box cutter slow dance  capture the damage
yo this dude talks real slow yo crazy
yeah man thats my boy steve he just talks like that its weird
that is weird
tune to hellemundo for action packed blasphemy
big city translate your face til it atrophy
i let the schadenfreude boy out actually
deployed to void with grin to watch laughingly
yeah bitch pass the ps its a laugh in
i can smell the tragedy when hatchin
happily dispassionately patched in
alive with the menace of demise
like yes the pain dazzles men pass the popcorn
pass the popcorn its reality at its fastest
and yet it still unravels at a pace like molasses
i guess the last of the seconds before the worst of disasters stretch past us
wouldnt you agree that it is fabulous
in the corridors of entropous wars contort drastically tilted fits
i adjust to climates of the wilderness
walk along my spine take the pilgrimage
up in to the section thats reserved for the smirk of the coldest witnesses
work you motherfuckers hooray theres all day to die
innovate the mayhem with grace
the good form fall fuck if imma warn yall nah
i got the front row to the greatest entertainment that an angel never saw
sixty thousand watts of that raw
pull the claw out of the trunk fun each one teach one how to club one
look at how they bathe up in the dove blood
its gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of mud mud
each one teach one how to club one  popcorn popcorn
each one teach one how to club one  popcorn wouldnt you agree that it is fabulous
yo honestly if your man steve really talks like that uh thats not really normal
yeah that sucks yeah its pretty bad
nobodys voice should sound like that
it was a lazy day it was amazing grace
it was a half a dozen claymores daisy chained
it wasnt daisies and crazy
eights it was an ace of spades over a waiting game of slaves
and saints and every trainee face painted while his great
escape grazed and ate
hell never make it when he aims he shakes
and i was overly engrossed from a very locked door
with a couple milk duds and buckets of popcorn
pass the popcorn clap clap encore monkey in the middle study
how the bunker took the missiles age of machines with nary a green
screen so the hecatomb is every bit as cutty as it seems
i could tell the pet from the vet money where his canines spread
and never welched on a bet that said know the over under
on your local hunter and youll profit off his widow makers
numbers every summer bump in the night funny will he catch and release em
has he mercy will he hack em to pieces
is he dirty will he hassle policeman and security breach until impurities leak over the circuitry
and nada milk and honey there is only skulls and bunnies
that hop around drunk in the land of a hundred mondays
god damn pop the redenbacher proper and
for christs sake get this man a doctor
