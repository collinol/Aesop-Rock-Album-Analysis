march
the more the merrier
get a couple or more to carry you to the burial
f r e s h
fresh to death and keep it def to the left
well it was capricorn virgo aquarius
check cancer leo sagittarius
check pisces libra scorpio aries gemini taurus
let em die for it
delicate freak show alert the frame
bash all flags where the mag spin park
corroded by the volts that jolt the cold vein
boogie down kits to slip past the guard
def with a mascot of radical mass
megaphone fuzz and a woofer on fritz
we are not trained to divert the crash
but march face first with a prayer for the blitz
stand up for the cinema fire simian ire
cold shimmy for the cinnamon sky
intimate eyes loop all known alleys
scoop the bounty like daddy hires bazooka to murder ralphie
i curdle with burnt milk pariah sigh honor piranha money
count it with the knuckle that hustle bread out a copper tummy
one of these rebels could level the marked city
but the ny uber alles governors picky
ill be the jenky jesus for the species you bleed with
ultra soldier poach the folklore
jump guns through the ninth gate
jump guns like a noon six burner lit up on the ninth pace
even set among a portion conformed to the blind stage
never lured by the formal watching imported wines age
we bow to the gusto mustered by the mecha bot
plowed by the public ushered out the letterbox
wowed by the subject punctured by the helicop
boy meets vermin the widescreen version
headaches nausea vomiting facial paralysis
these are a few of my favorite venomous side effects
mamba water moc pit viper diamond back
anaconda boomslang cobra bite em back
spinal tap crabs to the clapper
aesop rock is the cadillac of natural disaster
push that button
everybody gotta push something
thats why the envelope is where it wasnt
i work with the builders whittle my gorilla military
and fizzle em through the vigilante filters
who lamps left of the toggle
howd they fit that ninja in a bottle
done a hundred million motherfuckers with they hands out
versus a walking zipper bomb trying to keep the man down
get up get down
sit up sit down
its either fancy footwork or get bit by the hounds
face up face down
laced up laced down
its either fist to the sky or get bit by the crowd
well it was capricorn virgo aquarius
check cancer leo sagittarius
check pisces libra scorpio aries gemini taurus
let em die for it
i was chewing my tongue out of my mouth one day
when the blood in my beard hit the dirt by the blazers
would have said curb it like any nervous habit
til maverick told me the coyote pack could smell the wound for acres
and labor to cater fang to fisherman gut critters
oblivious to the glimmer of innocent duck feathers
fuck it
want a carnivore war bet
ill be at the bronx zoo with a lock pick kit
on the eject for cockpit bench helicop clip
nazi cops on kamikaze belly flop shit
roger hop fence kill a crop monster
we are the tired and poor we come for your water
boom
bounce when the church corrupt
when the mayor knuckle dust city worker bugs
when the stars finger babies like i flirt with sluts
youll see the fire engine red fox ears perk up
metal kettle unsettling treble howl settler trembling
measuring mellow on the levitate off the mezzanine
never seen a ton of bricks dressing clean dapper
til its pin stripe and skull chunk forty stories after
and usa on a ketamine disaster
cane for stress
crack if the former left you unimpressed
now pardon me if part of me heart of an oddball but damn
kumba fucking ya dog
terminally alienated and bent awkward by the bought
prepped package of the slickest spin doctors
raised where the paranoid hide tools proper
like suspicious cargo in a high school locker
and it looks like war quacks like war
so its occams razor and im swayze out the door
a hundred million motherfuckers hold me back
the hand cannons wont ask bout your zodiac boy
get up get down
sit up sit down
its either fancy footwork or get bit by the hounds
face up face down
laced up laced down
its either fist to the sky or get bit by the crowd
well it was capricorn virgo aquarius
check cancer leo sagittarius
check pisces libra scorpio aries gemini taurus
let em die for it
