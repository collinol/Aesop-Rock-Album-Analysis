smack dab in the middle of the cuddles and kills
guerilla jimmy city limits with a bucket of pills
hollring no i dont immediately ameliorate em
i meet em greet em read em and rate em see if i hate em
here come the hard rock bump through the speaker top
the tweeter meter blew code def hones in
i pack a lunchbox walk to the stoning
jump into the chemicals sold in my zoning
im irrational paranoid tragic
and the button on my chest says panic
punch it hold up dont touch me
im a savage from a rabid ass country
who want to get it
you all acquitted
you need to quit it
getting evicted you little idiot pitching tickets
its sorta tricky the way you wanna go get your digits
body you up at the party somebody get his mistress
you take a pitch black lung and a purple heart
then you kick back once the inertia start
and when the shipwreck sunk through the perfect dark
the serpents arch alerts every circled shark
see bloody salt water sounds the hors doeuvres alarm
and when the first arms found we observe the art
like a belly acher wont kick face to the curb
rather kick when the face already raped by the worms
tasmanian paint coat ridin
very little to say to these politician behind it but this
you better loosen the noose or lose livin
these little kids walking the ave quick to produce a biscuit
now you should medicate any area that the pain hits
and when you in the streets you should peep the sets of strangers
the actors that are in fact a cast of chaos
they be looking for any situation they can play on
respectively injecting these thoughts detain us
negative speaking they be creeping they entertainers
when you out of data they run through a route thatll save ya
in retrospect infect and pressing your papers
i design kill pain cave penmanship
federal analog hog unedited
with a cuny degree in young numbness
angels on the rooftop gun in they trumpets
i was buried to the neck in them all star bloopers
periscope down hop boss hog cruiser
porcelain or pewter authority will be over ruled the second jukie uber alles news hit the sewers

okay lefty fieldstealth
dressed to killself
megawatt with a horizontal neck spin
swims bloody to vertical bobble head yes men
when the evil falls in it draws to the pours
it gnaws to the core
its precedent in that you represented
a percentage that wasnt vintage
and the crawlers hate us
you automated we all the flavor
niggas you oughtta hate us
anyone from antagony squad family district
testify that the look in my eyes is genuine issue
im a freak of the flesh penetrate lust
bathe in the vaginal juices

the cores no picnic misled whores advancing
no business insist lured with candy
to cure citizen x with that all fours dancing
corporals landing
ashore all soar boned nitwit rickety rackety porn fancy
weave through the hell and high water hot zone
diseases in the minute the idiot got home
now im a teacher 1st grade and i want to participate

call every parent and give em a piece of my mind shit
cause i dont want to give a good future
