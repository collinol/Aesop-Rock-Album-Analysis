blazin with a facemelter
go fish
pigeon itching for a pit to put the pig in
scalped bottom feeder nose bleeder cheap seats
to the meat eater sweeps sweet freak freaks
what up
grip clicker smack the dummy box fix picture
stickle over shit cinema flicker in the plasma
the latch key degree was obtained in the savage years
where he learned the binding of a wire hanger to rabbit ears
every pixel that leaked dead over the carpet
had to be spit shinned and hidden before the ford duster parketh
when mommy marched in wrapped the broccoli in the napkin
for your electric paradisio after the parent crashes
and im high on ion jitters call it a prime directive of the damned
who grew to sleep easy to white noise
the humming of the machinery running towards them crawl
social retardation larvey plugged into the wall
the little short circuit with the still born vibe
till the villagers circled and determined it is alive
shipped to bellevue eyes fuzzy talking funny
like eagle one to grey squirrel whats your twenty dunny
i piss clumsy with electrode head pan sorry
pitty the pretty internet gotta empty the bed pan
left hand numb from the finger to the thumb right
right got tubes in it irony is fun yaaay
at some point early when drunk on electric kisses
id apparently notarized forms excusing scalpel slippage sign this
the pain came on a makeshift main stage
and sentenced to in an inoperable eight bit frame rate
for that i made a game play reborn torn
at the ministry of information trying to get informed
theyll duck it out and i will cease all wars
so if you babysit a caroline be fore warned
i be the ultimate ultimate multi polar
mobile medicine cabinet stocked adequate
pockets like maracas that will shake when he stepped
which explains the circle of rattlesnakes where he slept
smarter then the average bear barter parts and gadgets
with battery op enthusiast pardon the barking badgers
while you were parking daggers in kittens with snarling children
i was sharking classes with taggers for television click
gattaca days attica paper scattered
diagonal mahogany boggled the train savage
to boxed the botanically inclined child slave labor
blades clipped the perfect petal now play later
play never if escaped raped treasure
thats a jewel freebie out a old geezer no teether
or even yesteryear scrapes fester administer gauze
but cauterized wounds bleed if you aint ethered the cause
king of applause yay beats the garbage flood for ten
porn king of new york alley punk perv scum
waddle on the voyage of the voyeur
six four sick king breezer sniff whores through brick
i am so dangerous evil and mercy heaven
allergy to compassion he is the perfect weapon
un  earth it and siphoned from delorean doors swivel up
with aviator radar blip for most glorious titty fuck
cool green over the frame under the clothes line
whose crew choose fuel most mine
holy trinity triple six triple x city barrack
glutton for punishment super size me while you at it
he da
built hideoussilk of the milk litigant silly wicked finicky fidget the middle digit ish
will he alter what he feel is illy to pick at every little smidgen of integrity
as your industry bitch no
final answer track the moniker
to the freight hot reaking of butter beans and harmonica
dirty old man no tea cup thirst peak up skirts
for slaps from that d cup nurse
cackle his old gums lewd lewd crass
show the girl a trick like how he opens can food with the only tooth he has
she like thats fucking disgusting
they dont call him anabolic aes for nothing ok
now current picture aside all anti celebs remain aggro
half mast the flag pole
dead walk sturdy but the day i greet the worms
i pull the daisies down with me as a fuck you to the norms
generics so unappealing and in my humble opinion
defeats a rappers civic duty to the culture
granted every topic has been covered but cookie cutter
delivery of simpleton wit is the real culprit
so whether street club battle conscious or other
i find that interesting style can often out weigh the subject
so when the disc changer goes from guns to space
it is not an attempt to fake credibility for the public
but fuck it its ace rock six records of gibberish right
hes trying too hard to be weird and different right riiiiight
or could it possibly just maybe be his lessons
cant be summed up in a linear set of pop culture references
wow yeah but why try im so groggy
the mach nine ballentine aint for everybody
but i will say this to yall that used your fifteen of fame
to mention my name that sixteenth minute regret is fucking insane
and thats a longevity veteran peddling free medicinehere
who the fouler howler me who the rabble rouser
what the happy hour starved the peruvian aggy powdertight
trade up at the digital jesus factory outlet bout it bout it
bout it bout it fuck a fork tongue cutlery the fuckery is famous
never wild shook but a slang that maybe alienated a couple strangers
held a mongoloid fanbase that is alien by nature
robot wars machines hit the floor
and the simians syncopated a gigantic encore
alright im bored five minute bag of tricks
if you hate me you can eat a bag of dicks
