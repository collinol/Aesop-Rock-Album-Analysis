they were selfish with the helmets on the little bus
till brake fluid sewage crippled up the get retorted nickel punks
slowly cope but swore his lowly robot vole evoke
would one day rise in sections to interrogate the holy ghost
holy smokes
father black suit white collar
kiddie porn dungeon guns and three fingers for your daughters
caught belly up antique nazi paraphernalia
shucks fucker enjoy the alcatraz shower fun
and mommys mad im cliche generation x agnostic front
it aint the nifty fate the 1958 before the new new testament approved altar boy fisting rape
and take me to your leader
call me crazy but i bet that wasnt gods demeanor
but long island was jesus every weekend
spoon fed to appease traditional love bringing
of a middle pennsylvania shit hole where elders movement
stressed the stellar therapeutic bible cycle how
one church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much more
so the two moved to new york made babies raised on what they saw
christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy
but immaculate conception came second to playful goodies
like laser tag was way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags
grandma was a saint while hed paint with snakes and bullies
said if only youd memorized your prayers like you did your kool gs
by the time i was old enough to know what religion was
94 moved out the crib and it aint seen a steeple since
what knievel evil seeps in a christian leaders pitch
till priests laps slapped with parental advisory warnings
ill be auditioning gods in my office on monday morning
uh oh and yet another pill slipped
down the hatch and pass em through the kill switch
i need a couple as for qs
im not an asshole im just a little confused
helpful to others he said that one day the king would say to these people
come inherit the kingdom prepared for you for when i was hungry you gave me food when i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came to me
but the people asked when lord did we see you hungry and feed you
or sick or in prison and come to you and the king answered
in as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren
just a little bruise in the back of the pews
acting amused with a mask and them vatican blues
for in the eyes of the organization i was raised in
aes is just another sinning brick in hells basement
cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists
for what drugs and fucking its part of growing up
like cuffs over dumb shits is better than the schools
im not an asshole im just a little confused
just a lit fuse in the back of the pews
watching a thousand flavors of the same god feud
i figure ultimate peace is the common theme
so its a no brainer peace when the blood hit the screen
got a basic good and evil sensibility born
good neighbor know a halo when its fit over horns
im more science than faith im more karma than bread and booze
im not an asshole im just a little confused
not an asshole im just a little confused
not an asshole im just a little confused
