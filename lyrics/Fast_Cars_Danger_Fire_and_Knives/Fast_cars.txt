checkmate sucka not a move games over
whos that walking with a hole in his head
big bad bazooka tooth i came to break bread
whats a troops recipe for treacherous times
i tell em ah fuck it yo
i pull the elephant tranq out of my neck
gaffle a tank count up the chips wrastle the fangs off of my fist
flood a little soldier blood over the ogre acres
on some holiday in cambodia with motor home appraisers
pagans fade into the kodachrome   now later
with a lid to brow staple
revisit the cobra loading zone
molar foaming but he hold his own wound
cauterized by the zippo he had stole that afternoon
and my dog tags jingle by the monster island heart he built
grew up with a jughead crown tilt and tardy slip
be all you can be just never soothed us nope
you lost me in that part about scrubbing piss with a toothbrush
holler scums lullaby
live from the ultra fly sham city bunker
where the coldest cults multiply alarmingly
hush little baby timeout
the black market mockingbirds can not sing a lick
but learn to peck your eyes out
of commission with love out a tradition of wraiths
pick on the visions that buzz bet on the kittens escape
solder the piston to pump   out a veteran amplifier
and magnify through the same lens that set the ants on fire
flush the moppet hootenanny
who could fancy honor circuit when the circles every duke is clammy
trooper scoop the food in pantry
ante up stupid
may delusion feed em foofi candy
and pry the gold out of his tooth when lamping
pocket all you can now
block will lead the lambs down
to the cold cutlery outfit slaughter beef and cow tip
pour the chief some fountain soda motor prone to pen the holy opus
and pry this monkey off the scoliosis like
whos that walking with a hole in his head
bazooka tooth gemini i came to break bread
whats a troops recipe for treacherous times
i tell em fast cars danger fire and knives lets go
fast cars danger fire and knives
fast cars danger fire and knives
fast cars danger fire and knives
i got her majesty athena riding shotty wide eyed
its like never mind the bullocks
fuck like every other week these hipster tabloids
jumping on and off my sex pistols bullets
like every other week he spins the bottle
like every other week these fucking fanzines forget if they spit or swallow
too bad your inner sheep never forgets to follow
cause my inner greed to feed your hate for loving us is hostile
fortunate for me it coincides with what comes natural
so the mongrels that i run with turn the fuck yous into fast food
like a little freak sick of the 3 oclock bully knuckle dust
nursing his last shiner finds the shoebox in his mothers truck uh oh
tomorrows extra curricular punching bag
will finger daddys widow maker out a brown lunch bag bang
this is where the hunch back snake oil peddlers
stuck under the burgundy sky of spaghetti westerns
tend to bubble up weathermen huddle up
today the son of one too many yes sirs
kings his checkers watch the double jump
back with a platter of hot leeches thatll drink up every bloody drop down
to the last diseases its a e s o p r o c k the peak twister
defender of the son of vaughn bodes cheech wizard
i used to pray the treatments got easier with my aging
like serotonin weekends was merely comedic hazing
wrong but along his travels located the key to world peace
kill every motherfucker but me
you cool with that cool bang
you cool hang
you no uhbang cool
sorry dog rules is rules
and too long have i followed yours
im trying to get them years back
and walk through every cypher with dynamite in a beer hat
whos that walking with a hole in his head
bazooka tooth krueger i came to break bread
whats a troops recipe for treacherous times
i tell em fast cars danger fire and knives lets go
fast cars danger fire and knives
fast cars danger fire and knives
fast cars danger fire and knives
i got her majesty athena riding shotty wide eyed
