parachute ratty one bunk cord now the air is scooped badly
dripping out the sticks like a twig tweed hammock
miter cut the cables for that quick clean transit
miser took the big screen panic made a business card
ankle out of whack painkiller tobacco scrap
we navigate the yellow corn hype for the barn
when the spotlight swiveled hard right over the farm
post up 3 cheers for the gimp
spread thank you 3 on the right
limp to the door splint what he mangles 3 on the left
yea i knew the percentages
but the numbers were unaware of the grand finales emphasis
and over the scent of a thousand dead dogs
agent zip zooka swore to pull it off gameface
walkie talkies squawking up his hip regarding paratroopers 20 ha
tug a noise box trigger reporting for hunting
i have landed safely
i have not recieved my papers
i have zero natural enemies
i dont know my location
i have no training in reconnaissance combat or colluding
im calling for my orders over
strap on a helmet and start shooting
clonopin to kill a horse numb and bloodthirsty
till the uncle spitter beg a jungle pig to hug mercy ha
two 40 below shit kickers tickle the corpses duck
duck the widow maker also manufactures orphans ok
manufactures ornaments if it moves stick a fork in it
winners take all killers rape all coordinates
unfortunately courted by the most tenacious gaurdian
whose aimless nature bait a harlequin taste the martyrs skin
no semper fi nope no saluter unit
soldier the fire is more flesh than sulfur
and when the automatic jitters wiggle the ribs
i feel so alive it dont matter which bitches litter is clipped bang
sun down goggle up canteen gobble juice
teargas nozzle up brain buff hostile youth
chop it up lock a noose upon it
you will die for the glory ofshit i cant put my finger on it
but its big big and legitimate
justify women and kiddie killer shit iller it builds
so he is not a natural predator but can dismantle an ak 47
clean and rebuild before you can mayday bretheren mayday
muddy gut snake eyes he approaches cobras with an ugly muck
and bloody bowie knife clamped in the canines
wake em with that blind military mechanism set to bludgeon
what is your major malfunction
i have landed safely
i have not recieved my papers
i have zero natural enemies
i dont know my location
i have no training in reconnaissance combat or colluding
im calling for my orders over
strap on a helmet and start shooting
i was standing at attention with a pocket full of weapons
and the will to walk a mile in the same fatigues that i slept in
i have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting
im calling for my orders over
strap on a helmet and start shooting
i shimmy up out of the fox hole disorderly
only after having logged every cadaver accordingly
high scores keep our tama tongs enthralled
there is no course iller than no course at all
okay if his perspective is merked sneaky detective work is aborted
and its no longer whisper mode on the red alert
no bed of dirt sniper rifle peeking out the bunker uh
now im center city looking for something to puncture gunshot
help me up the numbers of the heroes sat at suppers
treat the public like a tin can riddled before it plummets brrrap
but adrenaline can lead to lazy eye hassles
so he missed the little boy inch the pin out the pineapple heh
thats funnybumps into the steel toe
thats lovely sum it up in oh hell no
and just as fast as the parachute cable snipped
i was rag doll horizontal two limbs short of fixed
link a baby pool around the standard issued weaponry
while fading as a blemish in civilitys memory
they will step over the body for the looting
ready on the firing line
the fuck is that
strap on a helmet and start shooting
i have landed safely
i have not recieved my papers
i have zero natural enemies
i dont know my location
i have no training in reconnaissance combat or colluding
im calling for my orders over
strap on a helmet and start shooting
i was standing at attention with a pocket full of weapons
and the will to walk a mile in the same fatigues that i slept in
i have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting
im calling for my orders over
strap on a helmet and start shooting
