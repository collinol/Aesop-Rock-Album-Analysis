stuck on purpose for tha love of birthplace
but would have carried you home inside of my teeth anyday
turns out i wasnt cast in the master plan anyway
he holds no grudge holds his tongue wow
same one she used to hold in both smiles
dagger the instinctual last shout if it killed me
so you can ride up in the sun city guilt free
one year passed the table is wobbling and your hollerin back
sippin the fits you skip when shit cracks
they never missed it
not a long haul bullshit kids kicked into the sink
shoebox with a flicks of lipstick
ill love you forever cuz you know me better
for the record at one time would have married you in a second
but kill the rekindling dreams and navigate the friendship
or else by the time the stress airs out well both be dead and friendless
