yeah nasa lets try this
park your bets
sharks or jets
his bark mark targets where the barnacles nest
they burrow deep under the carnivores flesh
without a trace
carnival games
like try to shoot the star out of his face
come double fist them aqua gats lock box your past and
spoon up the ballooning for high noon saloony antics
walk off with a thumbs up
and a stuffed bullwinkle trinket
pull twinkle out them awestruck baby sockets for a day
yeah thats the ticket
yeah thats the pipe dream
thats hater 101 bitch pigs
living guilt trips for the fan base family picnic
whos handshake carry with it
yall inspire me
its an honor to meet you
now its randomly fantasy beef stew
thats panicky pre school
thats keebler signs pikachu
and hes poking pinocchi beezer
where big brother watching aint
holler back wally cleaver
knobby kneed geezer
whose brittle peddle boat sank
wishing he could re stitch the images when the kinescope cranked
he couldnt
you cant
my more than two lamp with a mongoloid loyalty clause
and a done did got busy ambiance
thats lazerface megalasaur scissor tongue liftedly
money murs ramble printmatic hangar blockhead and ravipops
and the fam only begins with the last two bars he dropped
add the chrome fangs ill rewrite heavy metal parking lot
thats why these grapevines could pop shit to me all day
i only kick these fucking doors down to make sure the crew ok
like food on the plate
thread on the back
kicks on the palette
i rock the bells without clown shoes fried dough tickets or mallets
while the bearded ladies won goldfish from the ping pong toss challenge
threw like girls and misconstrued the lucky fuck floaters for talent
its sad really
ok im over it
smolder over composure models like smoke over soldier nostrils
3d bifocal goggle broke over cat walkers
there mustve been something up in that long island tap water
grew to mute grinch north of who ville and his frisky sissy poodle pack
oozing that hollow who the mac act aes threw back in junior rap
isnt it strange how its a fad to bite your idols
when the whole reason you liked em was cuz their shit wasnt recycled
come pigeonhole aesop like he aint heard it
thats no burden
need attention
better dress them diversions like stripping nurses
kid the cult is thick and medias the sacrificial virgin
purging little man behind curtain opinions
this is perfect
look im just like yall
living low pro to paycheck
and when the landlord hollers he hid the dro in the tape deck
rocket radio
every success smidgen he harnessed
parks with risk and sick with it clicking in perfect working ratio
no frisky out of dodge name blame for sneaky plots
with elevated rung placement derived from deep rooted jealousy issues
he cue the raging bull and every due is paid in full
with that i forget all you motherfucks that failed to pull
why well
whats really good
not a cat who peddles backwards for a hackers filthy looks
hodge podge menamena muppets available in rubber stamp form
hogwash harry clamp norm
wear the space cake baker
order up
curb his pacemaker
and vacate personal space in relation to face raker
built an einstein rosen bridge to 88 with lincoln logs and bobby pins
probably when ozs friends slept on the poppy stems
horseback 60 mph
one hand rolling tobaccy badly
but it burns out cavalry of concerned worms for mayor
but youll find validity in a penny right
and i got a clear flick of the loch ness sucking off yeti
with a knee jerk response to his budgetary woes
hes hooky out the institutions huckleberry mold
style leapt out a hermann rorschach margin mark
starving art smashy to slash a martyr heart
trashy to lap her garter belt
this is 6 flags definitive jux baby
we like love it or leave it out your holler box now
cripple a kitten if a kitten is a culprit
youre spilling insignificant frijoles
