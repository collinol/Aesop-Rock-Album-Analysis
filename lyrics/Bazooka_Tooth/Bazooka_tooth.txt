that jackhammer is so real
diamond cutter spine
armadillo armor that bends around the blades
bugs in the beard
ebony in the lungpiece
bricks in the timbs
bazooka in the tooth that hes flashing at your friends
this is the lifestyle baby
no insipid recipes
not a single innocuous atom in the centerpiece
oh my god
journalists across the globe are officially critiquing my first eight bars
piety for the fam embargo piggybackers
navigate sim city backwards
bazooka tooth baby
zephyrs less detrimental expect to tone down terrordome for starter crews
like jousting pompeii with a garden hose
if you wake up to the sound of helicopters bumping wagner
its bodycast the pilates class
rumble in the bronx back alley batting cage with bottle smash
drag them prophecies
be them celestine or mothman to the bumper boat monster mash
you see the pristine kittens fiddle with new yarn
decrepit sickly dogs get shot behind the barn
one champ put in long hours like tim learys lava lamps
just to be second headlined under the boy born with lobster hands
isolated biological phenomenon
verse nocturnally orchestrated car alarms
yall sketch portraits of your neighbors tack em up without fail
see a row of red pitchforks and bifurcated tails
official max fischer blume brake cable clipper def
picket train buffer the riverboat and the switcher jux
pipe dream of that so fresh and so clean plumage
as an appleseed aborted resorts to bazooka tooth shit
you dont want me smiling at your cameras
