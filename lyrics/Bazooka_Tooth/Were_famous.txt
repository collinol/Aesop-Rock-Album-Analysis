i brought that genuine shit in 96
before you knew the underground or independent existed
i watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick
after stepping to kcr lit and flexing my shit
no gun talk no gimmicks just rounds of raw dogging
dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering
a hardcore poetic informed without burglary
potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me
everytime i prescribe a new pill revolution
quickly defined the standard for indie rap distribution
arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks
bad touch example that soon became bucks
had everybody sprung wondering where i came from
screaming out independent as fuck with an insane tongue
with an indelible squad of design monsters
innovating the styles that made biters look like imposters
so we scripted an album and signed to rawkus
selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit
preposterous sonics taking the world hostage
classic hip hop bombage dirty with style progress
now ive come from the 80s juvenile brooklyn
where cats was like gimme that subway pass kid good lookin
now someone else is taking a ride with whats mine
so i had to develop styles with a death device cooked in
so when i battled in basements i had eight sentences
waiting way before the four you had laced in
and i was taught to wait patient why
only faggots make shit up just to get famous
so when i finally blew up i remained sick
earning respect in ghettos and burbs for word placement
back when the independent scene remained faceless
we were the only crew who promised your ass wed take it
mold it shape it living outside the matrix
hold it make it more than miniature major labels
hold it sacred living it for the culture
told ya plainly protected it from the vultures
thats why i always get respect from true soldiers
while half of the critics claim it every year hip hops over
fuck you hip hop just started
its funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it
but true veteransll give dap to those who started it
then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit
new slang new thought new sound
whos heart you thought you had
you clown you dont you drown
i wont dumb it down im dumbing now for these rounds
im a live mothefucker plus im gunning for clowns
youre a mime motherfucker dont be coming for pounds
so you can break out of that invisible box youre not down
my favorite ones are the ones who started that young rap about
comic books spaceships and obi quan one
and even though they were soft they had fun
but they couldnt break out the frame of the town they came from
some of these faggots used to send me their demos
im keeping their puppy styles in the company flow kennels
but since they had no identity from the start
they started to resent the scene when they couldnt become a part
theyve been failing for years and call themselves vets thats bold
motherfucker youre not a vet youre just old
ill slap the shit out of you to continue my nerd rap
making this money fist over fist fuck what you heard
jukie cats talk about boom bap and golden ages
patting themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit
ive been putting out vinyl since 93 and never looked back once
and yall trying to chase me
you dont innovate because you cant innovate
its not a choice despite what you might tell your boys
keep your identity crisis under the table
i always knew who i was and ill always be more famous
check it
for the best in the vendor biz
1 800 lazerface
leave the last ce off for craps and buy them haterade
dig it daddy dug his own tunnel under the gutters where the numbers bleed
hunters froze up and exposed rapunzel weeds
tugboat tug up through that brutal dirt first
the fuedals fuming oodles it was right under your poodle skirt
welcome to bazooka works halogen halo eyesore
the revolution will not be apologized for
warbucks exlex megaphone on the fashion piggy pageant
while my dicks raw dogging a style magnet
fraggle rock your four figure watch
i clock ninety nine cent wristbands
and still know the time when you record flops
now this is on a sick with it factor
exhibit a e s genesis of the klepto reactor
wanna burgle the buzz over definitive cash
after a life of labor camps starts paying innovaters back
baby you aint felt the collective coooool
stop running bases with little bears under the wing of punchdrunk buttermakers
that engine sputters while the hound dogs wire cutter mechnical rabbit
bantam weight puppies aint rabid enough to snatch him
pockmark ninety moses approach with a golden focal point
come soak in it résumé sturdy composer soldier bliss
wrong name by a molar can often expose your phobias
watch a cobra grow hands to hold his own tongue when he notices
all city legity critter bark with me
all filthy documents cats piss on their kittie litter moccasins
welcome to mi casa monsters inc dropping bangers out the rocket ships
your own private apocalypse
honor it
for fucks sake

wild fly
you wanna read the nile
i twitch easy reader
father it

original
wide open with banged out cutlery from a slang mouth teacher
and money is an ugly god we all fall for
i got land mammal cannibal natural evolving squackbox
that means when i wake up and decide to comprise the new shit
its not some watered down version of what my favorite crews did
puff the magic komodo bitch
rappers stuffed kimonos and shark fame at a perfect working unit
look im done
b boy feed that to the needy
shut your liquor hole fuck you in 3d
easy
