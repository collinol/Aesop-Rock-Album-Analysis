i cut the ropes breathe
fresh puddles of pigeon blood and smoke load bazooka
scoped the culprit hulks over a broken hookah
got rebel camps with siphons amped to cookie cut the wattage
electric ilk ny raised on b movie sluts and gossip
conditioned the bodega rodent moment composure to echo numb and uncommon dumb monkey pollen
my 23s lean over a cobra motor milligram bender novelty
i tip lids prior to clipping the comradery
check the muck out
when metal maggots burrow in promised land vein division i tug my brim down over my astigmatism low pro
paxil rose axl broke and butchered
last catapult standing in a land of coke and hookers
king kong potluck no parking for rickshaw loads of sock puppets and sitcoms
just krylon pigs bred in a hot boxed wigwam
serotonin deficient teens demonstrate ease in the modern day uzi purchase
the foundation of their alacrity makes the mothers nervous

hes labeling the dolls with the names of shitty rap artists nooo
then tearing out the still beating heart from the loose leaf carcass
i ordered a hovercraft off the back page of an archie comic
built it in three days to float above snarky comments
my gills call the east river rock bottom home with three eyed guppies and seahorse mutations
see new york is ancient rome basic basically stone faces
my friend jumped off the empire state building while i hung with 10th grade head cases
some of them will blossom famous some of them will blossom baseheads

i was on a serious tree bender with my hands up at a c rayz walz show
nether circuit bacon dont police me anymore
your trained professionals demonstrate 41 shots over par
least common denominator raise truth like charlie willy and gramps raise roofs in a glass wonkavator monster maker
operate wild by the company of unturned stones and litter
talk his way out of a sunburn and be home in time for dinner
paid dues since before the days of bad acid and quaaludes
while the boombox talks trash to the richter
stalking awkward with a zip lock on the pill hole
bitter fucker nothing is free
ill spend my last dollar on me
put one up for my family shouldve made time to thank em
put one up for my crew for recognizing the sanctum
put one up for the socially broke choked and smoky new york piss hiss bleed dolby homey
