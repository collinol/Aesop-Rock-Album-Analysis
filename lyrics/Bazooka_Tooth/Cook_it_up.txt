i flashed the grossest fang in show biz
young valkyrie is open whats yours
um jenny um
body clocked in a ten penny sum
sprung colossal miss may i process your pentium
but ae is hesitating
my princess
the pigeonholing rose out your predecessors lunacy in the kismet
her eyes googled back as that of one unfortunate breed plus a new kink in the posture
just dont get all barnacley
or get pt barnumed in 3d thx sound stereo dismissal
sorry hun its just the last few have been a fistful
like like them girls you bump into out dumb luck
get high and innocently kiss once when shes punch drunk
watch her misinterpret the moment tongues touch
crazy mccling a lot claim instant one love
and youve gotta beg your friends to take em off your hands like thumbcuffs
or them barbies youll vibe for a sexy second lovely
give it a month hyde heckles jekyl and she makes hitler look cuddly
but jenny in the sky with emerald eyes

and if i cant wear jeans and sneakers then i wont be lamping there
nope aggro pimp sinfully finicky nova bag it up no diggity soldier
magic touch fingertip donor
own up to your dirty debutante animalistic instincts
ritual courting dance and breeding behaviors like what
i dream of jeannie and fucking her obsecenly
but jenny could be jeannie so easily if youd let me
hell the bad tact daddy o merlin   e for effort
most of these high post fabio world motherfucks make my head hurt

dolly i love you get the fuck off me sorry call me
and im circling her like a tiger shark frenzied but friendly

because when it comes down to it most of yall females are the same
but now its your turn baby spit it out
okay she punched me dead in the fuckin mouth and walked away
ow fuck
watch out ladies cause you know he dont love ya
bazooka tooth is one bad motherfucker
hes a low life pimp with a low life game
he needs a no life dame with a strobe light frame
cook it up now
no ring on the finger
there aint no strings attached
but if you love television and
manic depression
get a carton of cigarettes
and we can make it happen
get to mackin
just leave your baggage on my curb with the trashcans
it aint like i seen you in maxim
relax with the tap dance
lights camera lap dance
cook it up now
