i dont wanna do it anymore
couldnt do it if i tried wouldnt do it if i wanted it
hey
i dont wanna do it anymore
couldnt do it if i tried
okay the moments were subtle but unstolen and guess who owns them
no friendly non threatening corporate lacky mucks in the totem
lucy was in the sky with diamondsfive dollars to hold em
the summer van eek beat pac man with acid behind his molars
little white tab tolerant little white flag waggling
inorganic pat on back trim the panic flat on backer
back to back like mad hatter magic rabid mastiff collaborative   splatterbachelor fabric fatter with cabbage patch lit
dark days ben and louie louie park blazed chemically  
bent up but eager to crash for that one two three repeater
good morning vietnamwhose couch is this whose house is this
who are you down with bitchim sorry dog i dreamt the foulest shit
there was this rabid foot talisman drowning out of my armspan
whats fouler was the other farmhands growing gills and shark fangs
whats fouler was my torso stripped to ribbons in the marshlands
but im up now
lets get this window pane and shut the fuck down
down by the river where the litter sits  
and lion heart critters smoke dope and act like illiterates
i ran with a brat pack of loose bolts and high social maladjust ees
sacred numb and boundless went to st protocol cut me well  
i was dummy to some when the tongue was cradled and my skin looks crazy
pocketbook mirror courtesy amyspiders in the  mattresspaisley sunglasses dilated eyes green
ice grill that could burn through your picture in picture widescreen
poison late late show starring aes and in a jigsaw face of  
twelve hour solid gold entertainment utter shit to self  
from mothership to stealththey dd pace be space invader
this ones for the labor days work for rent and rolling papers
only the illest beats leak absurdly out the boombox
the daytripper anthem goes wake drop walk to aquarium
whistle while you work like a canary lungall work  and no play makes jack a dull boy to carry drugs
i sorta see it as my last blast in summer uhn
skateboards and sloppy psychedelics and big numbers
good times good peopleall airbrushed  
on a collapsible easel peace man easy
and i knew the permanancy would drift
and i knew the ph balance wasnt right
and i knew the crash and burn how to caress it
lsd flashed the message
and i knew the gash wasnt gonna stop bleeding
and i knew the ph balance wasnt right
and i knew how september would then affect it
lsd
lazy summer days
like some decrepit landshark dumb luck squad dog lurks sicker deluded
last sturdy domino leans secluded
dont let stupid delusions lesson super duty labor students
dragnet lifer solutions
daddy loved sloppy dimensions like son daughter links
such determinated lepers successfully disheveled
little soliders developed like serpents despite life sentence ducking
lemmings
some dont like sobrietys dirty lenses
some do
let sleeping dogs lie still
dont look so damn lackluster
suck defeat
lump summed damage
load sample delete
late show dave letterman shitty diner lip slide dutch
low self discipline leaders see dead lung self destruct
life sucks dickhead
lost summers display laminate showcasing divinity live
system definitive
liturgy soaked depict lowly spectactular delight
why what kind of lsd you like
your lizard king has spoken all hail
you in the back of the muck those trails arent necessarily bunk
summertime
somell try and recapture the same flag
but i played it smart and recognized the summertime passed
