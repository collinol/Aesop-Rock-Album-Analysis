burn train buffers
my fancy
up jumps the boogie delivering eye jammies
walk through the muck with a clutch on a trident
never give a fuck how far pi went
you are dealing with a reborn icicle age poltergeist
uprock sidewalk cycles stuck at the bus stop
wookie foot must not sleep
under the invaders
no batteries
no jumper cables
wired under agers play box cutter face lift
rock utter makeshift spirit
to yall im just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records
and a bangin hand style to put the jukies on the guest list
walk for that
metal train graf brainiac
walk for them
not a limelight
more to blush alizarin crimson
when the multi million
tin men suck traditional rituals
out the homes of starving children
and i bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites
formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly
dirty dub vamp
bruised by the hues of wicked pallets
chewed by the tooth of livid maggots
dino dna and cola straight no chaser
mars attacks colorfulness
i piss raptors on motherships
hazy days will stay purple
cause cips with a z bargain
like crazy eddie commercials
go ah ah ahh ahhh
network with a dirt devil

hi
cute the way your little parasol spins
bye
suck my neanderthal dick
catapults spit
losing the screws and bolts
and all they heards crews gulp in bulk and sulk in volts
zap
radio m m m m mayhem fine
suicidal eye full of plastic nine
bang

curators cater to killers of innovators

no batteries no jumper cables
choke train buffers like a headlocked ed koch
nurture the craft of concrete visionaries
cave painters screaming loosen the cuffs
cave paintings get the natural history feather dust
pick a lust
limo tint stretch delorean chrome sittin on twenties
then i walk to the stouge burning my laundry
lo pro
fucked up jeans back at the party spinning kane meets flight of the valkryies in a heartbeat
saber tooth catalog city art liturgy
ranger ricks endanger the clique maximum efficiency
and isnt that dope
the line of blind winged pygars and how they wallow planks into the matmos
binder bibles and a graphite prison violator
with joshua for the war gamer systems
now the architects are rioting cause we built something different
im like how the fuck sure shot evolution not my business
my elephant television was on
grape soda grape ape great space coaster
dnd gi joe transformer herculiod thundercat voltron speed racer space ghoster
kiss the flickering images with carroll ann fingertips
c 4 to four chamber skips
ohh shit
they say his eyes were spiraling back when he hit the mat
woke first words oh its like that
started bendin spoons and rippin arrows outa lady hawks
with a c3p unit tryin to interpret the baby talk
burn train buffers
right turn woulda missed the iceberg fine
but you dont like our kind do you
junkyard dog hot tin roofs cradle kittens with them sub par flaws
rappin is my radio graffiti is my tv
b boys keep them windmills breezy
