let me put you up on bobs donuts
controller of the warm deep fryer that charms cobras
mostly it was aggravated ulcers over goats legs
will they go for maple custard buttermilk or wolfs bane
hm late after your cinderella pulsate and crash i was rotating casts
picture if you will a witching hour on a weak night in the trenches
where paranoia dead ends in a bright florescent heaven
with sprinkles i know right yum
whether tummy ache or fever
keep the funnel cake im honey glaze in vitro
in the company of similar believers
sleepless who hear the walls breathe and foam at the facial features
now the yeast a phoenix in the partially hydrogenated
equal parts flour faith healing
might replace your previously nominated jesus
but only if you privy to the following secret of all secrets
shh every night at 12 they would march out from the back
with a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
show up around 1 never get your god back
if youre just tuning in walk into the light
walk into the light
i boil oil too not for scarfing
for ccs of japanese innovation that screech into free parking
purple heart and second chin that beseech him to squeeze the carbs into the motherboard
you can chew the eucharist in cruller form
locally a seedy danish underworld is bustling
where jellys not a celebrated stuffing its a puppet string
pluck nose for canola
5 cow stomachs like a mime with a rope going nowhere
fast right hand of god on my shoulder crows feet swollen dopey
combing apple fritters over with folk of opposing cultures
baby sitter cop thief reverend body glitter botched c section bronze teeth
each progressively more sequestered
yet if threatened will defend the raisin bread as codefendants
some lose religion or view it as superstition
you can tell a friend if you are down to kill them
shh every night at 12 they would march out from the back
with a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
show up around 1 never get your god back
if youre just tuning in walk into the light
walk into the light
the fat boys are back foam fingers over open arms
to feverishly reclaim their stomachs from golden jars
and stagger through the pulse ofthe gulch on a builders dividends
hiding high behind his guilty powdered sugar fingerprints
seething eventide fever sidewalk feeling a little dicey
im snake eye straight to the cakes icing
might fortune teller up your favorite paper tiger stripe
great grace invaders the first name basis patron haters
who compromise the pilot lights and flavors
silent night holy night invite the pious out the pagan
midnight kitchen doors un caging the enablers like butchers in bloody aprons
can i get a fucking amen
amen hazelnut raiders of the lost navigate consecutive pastries like stations of the cross
no name no dayjob
know the folk where it virgin mary toast by the loaf
thanks bob
shh every night at 12 they would march out from the back
with a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
show up around 1 never get your god back
if youre just tuning in walk into the light
