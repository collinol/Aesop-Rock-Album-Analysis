birds of a black
black feather stick together forever and ever and they always remember you
and all of the shit you do
they pass it to the baby birdies and then they remember too
little baby blue eyes eyes turn black
without forgetting the face of the guy in the mask
when you see me baby will you scream or will you laugh
little baby blue eyes eyes turn black
4 and 20 gory pantone black crows shredding innards
the silouettes are fencing lefty scissors
separating horn and hoof as evils own arpeggiators
they piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors
buy the getty image green cheese moon
dead of winter shit graveyard tchk tchk
shifter shit brother was a face card
crown like a heart shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his hydro plaining pace car chase
wait up let me isolate the bass more
gate of gods acre
aim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here
supposedly closurel free the vipers out the bosom
personally i think its a bunch of bullshit
prisoners tradition is for lovers
god forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some dip or play the dozens
now i baptize skips in larvae and dental records
on a little plot pregnant with 6 million sentence enders
and the tech support for tragedys emphatically horrendous
teenage operators explaining what bated breath is
pass i wish it were something i could diagram on a napkin so you wont feel so detached if it should happen to you privately
publicly your shadowsll cat call back
happy to split the button eye and burlap doll
crack the crypt
bats eject like cousin deaths wing ed lapdogs ricocheting sonar of the sacrilege
now let me slow this whole shit down for all you half goat cowards
ill even grit my teeth for you
i am so completely off the god damn grid its not a question of addressing me
its what do these symbols under the dresser mean
perhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young
couldve used a good lung
still proximity to corpses wasnt nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors
fast forward my knee in the gut of a glass coffin
remember that cow in the deans office seems awkward
and i know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous aint it
maybe a dialog of howls that reshapes thejowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines
either way   dope stone lion
and they call to let you know your friend is dead in a box
the crows have the tools to get the meat out of the box
scientific ritualistic headstone cold foxes still rot
im not gonna rot no fuck that snot
you can let them let you rot man
but im not going to watch
im not gonna stand atop your plot
i love you friends but im just not
on the other hand if your ashes are scattered in the sea
i will swim in the sea and youll be with me
and if your shit is scattered at the roots of a tree
i will climb that tree
everything you think youre hiding shows
in the way you view the graves like a string of tiny thrones
messages youd tucked away for keeps has resurfaced to be heard amidst the butchery and beaks
you dont want the passengers to pass
you want each cow taxidermyd fatter than the last
mausoleum lighting is a rush
while it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch
a proud chest puffed to the heavens
holds nothing if were cutting past the muscle and the tendon
and we will be cutting past the muscle and the tendon
