uh greasy grimy gopher guts
poolside o for 1 and dont forget spoons twice
lukewarm folgers mold on his moonpie
rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
my duty go from moving in packs to sharing food with a cat
to mom its me i accidentally sawed a woman in half
she said ill keep you in my prayers i said i need to hide a body
she said ok honey talk to you on friday
apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesnt matter according to the blood and water chapter
weird who wrote the blood and water chapter anyway
probably some surly dad only child 30 cats
looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
except it doesnt always work like that
today i pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn
i told them you will grow to be something inventive and electric
you are healthy you are special you are present
then i let them go
oh
you were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
i was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
in the mirror sweating pitchers whos there simian or lizard
as it were there is a disappearing difference
in ambition and material
antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
move as a godless heathen black gums tooth gone bootleg yukon cornelius
im a thats better here we here we go
disenchanted face printed on a zero dollar bill
got a little plot of land where authority isnt recognized
contraband keeping the core of his hyde jekyll ized
check never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
it is something he must handle on his own the wind blown way wanna win dont play
today i pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark
where the grape vines climb a convenient barn
i told them you will grow to be something tenacious and exalted
you are mighty you are gracious you are lauded
then i let them go
oh
i have been completely unable to maintain
any semblance of relationship on any level
i have been a bastard to the people who have
actively attempted to deliver me from peril
i have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up
and lip that kissed me on the temple
i have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition
that admits it wish its history disassembled
i have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance
while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
i have been unfairly resentful of those i wish
that acted different when the bidding was essential
i have been a terrible communicator
prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
i have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels
today i pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand
where the low tide showcased a promised land
i told them you will grow to be something dynamic and impressive
you are patient you are gallant you are festive
then i let them go
oh
