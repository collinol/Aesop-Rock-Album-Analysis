ian why dont you say grace
dear god thanks and if you loved me vegetables would be extinct
now im looking down the barrel of a string bean side like an exodus of biblical proportion redefined
rectangle seat 4 squeeze 5
each one may not be excused from the table til the green gone
stomach revvin up an episodic rerun
wheres a dissipating plume of smoke when you need one
chris and graham hate em too but advocate a braver chew invented for the code red cola chaser nose held gulp
moments later 2 have been released
leaving me the legroom and the legume police
going freeze you with the pretzeled arms
send your fabricated nausea my best regards
and know this kitchen as a prison til the pea pods die
i could sit here all night
so could i
who was at the door just now
kids on dirt bikes asking you to bunny hop the curbsides really
yup i told em oh he busy he staring at his green beans being a total pussy
blink twice if you are being held hostage
i speak and spell of a sleeper cell in the hospice
woke impersonating busy little helpers
that intimately purr between the hiccuping up of feathers
pick a porcelain dish
a single portion canned
frozen or fresh
defies the glory of the poultry or fish
via communal bloodletting that rupture the spud levy
no 87 supper scape was truly flood friendly ever
including at your basic cemetery for contaminated textures 60 minutes into never
where room temp heirlooms emanate a crude black mist
to a rendition of dude dads pissed
tell dad dudes pissed too
not to mention genuinely brandishing a the new gill hue
still out mule any last strafing watchmen
til the lord taketh waiting as an option
who was at the door just now
kids on dirt bikes asking you to bunny hop the curbsides really
yup i told em oh he busy he staring at his green beans being a total pussy
who was at the door just now
kids on skateboards asking you to navigate the claymores really
yup i told em oh he cant he in the kitchen pouting and terrified of a plant
less like toes in a tide pool
more like left right poached from notable giant kaiju
fat neck fine tooth rock and lean yelling
this ends now eat the god damn beans ah
hangdog mouth talk slang wrong and that theres flatware exhumed by a crane arm
time for some action
stab one ripe for a swipe and extraction
brined in malpractice
carried to the cavernous yap and obliged access
if only in compliance with a deep fried fascist peep
literally bite down once
and my tongue get a flooding from my uninvited guts
pointer finger plug a hole in the dam
ma notice ok gross blowfish dinners over go spit pop call bullshit
both of my brothers break in like hes on his davie hogan no mistakin by the way
who was at the door just now
kids on dirt bikes asking you to bunny hop the curbsides really
yup i told em oh he busy he staring at his green beans being a total pussy
who was at the door just now
kids on skateboards asking you to navigate the claymores really
yup i told em oh he cant he in the kitchen pouting and terrified of a plant
