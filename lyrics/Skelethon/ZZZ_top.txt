somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
composed themselves enough to artfully carve zoso in his desk
they was probably thinking fuck you fuck you fuck you in they head
with a hell bound arm in a acidy wash
homemade curfew a thousand oclock
and the pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
like a badge of mystique though it technically sucked
taking the name of the father in vain
on the way to the blade in his locker
estranged
a switch he lifted from a siblings skivvy drawer
whod branched off into ninja stars
and never knew his shit was sharked to
here with a higher purpose
and a prime alert to juvenile berserkers
like crocea mors in a arcade drop claw
gouging a valentine for miss othmar
watch
capital zed slowly maneuver the o
s is the most difficult to control
finally o
into the eye of goliath you go
that levy crushin percussionll pull the monkey upright
twelve or ghetto blaster
black or technicolor telecaster
lecture at a faster rate than class was making them develop backwards
it would appear you spelled out all the answers
when they ask how you feeling you tell em you feeling like
something important died screaming you tell em you feeling like
something even more important arrived breathing something you should probably try feeding
when they ask how you living you tell em you living like
something important died hissing you tell em you living like
something even more important arrived giving
something you should probably try willing
alright same here
somebody in a cultivated moment of distrust
composed themselves enough to magic marker zulu on these chucks
they was tryin to do the buckle font from renegades of funk
in a 3d frame of exploding brick
and whiz lines for the locally motion sick
beyond gross but evoked a host of oh dip
where a social neurosis owned the whole strip
heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth
in the marrow of waiting his guardians out
flashlight
chisel tips
milked venom
pistol grip
images relocated from milled vellum to scissor kick
silent agreement at hand
king of the hill for a queen of the damned
she in the doorway seething began
that clean white pair had a 3 year plan
oops
capital zed radical u in the cut
truly to beautiful loser it up u and he done
collateral damage a future alum that key to shambala
planet rocking bambaata
sample chop
churning out a cancer for the vandal squad
analog
and he finds
animated colors on a page
like synthesized cultures on a stage
when they ask how you feeling you tell em you feeling like
something important died screaming you tell em you feeling like
something even more important arrived breathing something you should probably try feeding
when they as how you living you tell em you living like
something important died hissing you tell em you living like
something even more important arrived giving
something you should probably try willing
alright same here
somebody in a cultivated moment of resolve
composed themselves enough to publicize the zeros in this stall
they was scoping every dog and pony previously scrawled
with a festering hate for the gum drop edge
disco sucks tee punks not dead
but a transient teen unsung godsend
via 3 bar chords and a mugshot grin
cheese
sign of a runaway tone in the face of authority thumbing its nose
cutting its teeth
pretzled up in special order vinyl and
birds that dip their belts in little metal porcupine quills
2 dutch at a show in the front low key to the can
for a smoke and a fuck trixie fixing her lipstick up
when his mitts got bit by the mischief bug
snatch
capital zed terrible in vermillion red
over a web of the shittiest bands
that beat your heart out
never bleeped your favorite parts out from a learned curve
of bird fingers bursting out of germs burns
urgently
offered through the circuits of an earlier plot
ill see you at the bottom zzz top
