die already
none defy the one man walled city
stone made flesh veins etched in his hands
88 stance draped in invasive plants
and rain dance unsafely brace for the supercell
mutiny or footage for your blooper reel who can tell
pours hot tar from the top of the barn
necktie on his head condor on his arm
dog star in a jar bordering unsustainable
mea culpa mea culpa maybe i should pray occult
systematic catholic or sigil of the baphomet unraveling
either way his id show a snake and skull
always been a private dude who couldnt keep a tally
of which lies he told who
dye his hair shave change names and his lazy drawl
soon enough i will estrange you all
i get ghost
on dasher
half dead carolers deck a hall wreck a whole advent calendar
brother on speakerphone lurking at the burgerville
bathrobe hammer toes murdering the curb appeal
would i be returning or forsaken with the craven and
carnivourous vegetation that take him for his steak umms
i dunno i gotta think about it
truthfully i dont know which makes me a bigger coward
either stomach all the hubris cash in his two cents
loose lips locked up over a chewed eucharist
or maybe re appropriate the energy
holed up passing the poultry to hecate
bullheaded burn out fled his own pedigree
and never better never wouldve met your heaven anyway
anyway merry merry go make soup out of bones
just know when the room go cold
im a ghost
g h o s t
ghost ghost ghost
hes ghost
flea comb exorcism and de worming
fitted for a curse and a crown of birds circling
search party falling forward unthwarted
meet him at the crossroads drawn and quartered
for a master of puppets how sad are his cupboards
non dairy creamers can of last supper
and a runneth over cup full of black tap water
its a marvel of privacy over pack hunter
raspberry jelly on his jesus toast
and turn heather gray sweats into easter clothes
with no immediately measurable crimewave ice age
christ children still skin a cat sideways
i dont pick teams or administer bans
im in the creek with a pick and a pan it go
forcibly ejected or a voluntary death scene
tell em what the out of order blinking emf mean
ghost
