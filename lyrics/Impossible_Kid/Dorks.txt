question if i died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face
i used to floss the albatross like daddy kane with the chain
im trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
the kid is comfortably numb routine a tedious crutch
steep in a self imposed stockholm and lima in flux
maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
its a theatre of jumping jellyfish jealous little sycophants
miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants
each one separately convinced
theyre sketching with da vincis hands
delusion turned the communication to prison camp
you fucking dorks aint a threat to the cause
there aint a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
i think its funny when defendants from identical haunts
step out the tempest a measure of what the spectrum involves
maybe no one cares party over here ill be over there
dont need no help all by myself
i used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
it meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
i know some shit about your heroes that you wouldnt believe
i think were all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
the songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog
thats why its odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
in a mess of obnoxious fantasy posturing and pageantry
i aint even mad im impressed shit its baffling
god almighty chop an ivory tower to piano keys
play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach
you fuckin dorks aint a source of the art
you cant be cooler than the corners
where you source all your parts
the poker faced all it takes a couple sordid remarks
we let the manticore out we make the sorcery bark
life is so unfair party over here ill be over there
dont need no help all by myself
i view the rattling of sabers like a show to expose
insecurities exploding in emotional code
when braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross
corrode a homie til his probity is notably ghost
before the hobby was a jobby was a miniature hell
you would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
the disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
but you as anything menacing is a difficult sell
in a whistle and bell o rama
black mollies that dress up like piranha
its not even compelling melodrama
its a comedy somebody wanna shop you as a saga
im very voluntarily persona non grata
you fuckin dorks aint the leaders we need
this aint the medium for divas out to weasel and breed
im offin coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen
dont make him show the regency what disobedient means
heavy load to bear party over here ill be over there
