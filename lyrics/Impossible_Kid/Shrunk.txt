my first name is a random set of numbers and letters
and other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever
my last name a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole
to a susurrus it couldnt just be john doe or bingo
my address a made up language written out in living glyphs
lifted from demonic literature and religious text
telephone uncovered by purveyors of the ouija
then checked against the cbgb womens room graffiti
my social a sudoku my age is obscure
my in case of emergency is in the daisies chasing birds
employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores
and people who open doors for the people who open doors
my medical history is a course at suny buffalo
charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow
nervous in the service still im burger meat and purple pills
here thank you well call your name sure you will
skipped lunch im shrunk
you pack up all your manias youre sitting in the waiting room
youre dreaming of arcadia youre feeling like a baby tooth
awaiting panacea channeling your inner beowulf
in purgatory just before you pay up to filet yourself
and others in the name of help coal on a conveyor belt
into ego death alone no telephone from gabriel
im half a human combin over home and garden stoned
gold chains over turtleneck cigars over cologne
a thousand shitty paintings wrap around the wounded animal
woo him with the schubert hes a future human cannonball
little fuckers fighting mother hiding in her hulu
im climbing up the stucco lets get to the seppuku
uh oh that pretty penny turned the prickly into benji
if you save up all your winnings then you get to count your blessings
i finally crunch the budget up and punch the button
she called my name out and pushed me into an oven
the fuck im shrunk
she says im not your enemy
i said that sounds like something that my enemy would say
instead of playing off the chemistry
she said youre being difficult
i said im being guarded youre a quarter mil in debt
i get more guidance from my barber
look im not good at this i grew up in a noogie fest
you built your walls up high
or say goodbye to all your cooky puss
heres one every time my telephone buzzes
i see images of hooded riders setting fire to hundreds
she said when you start getting all expressive and symbolic
its impossible to actualize an honest diagnostic
i said when you start getting all exact and algebraic
im reminded its a racket not a rehabilitation
okay agree to disagree as grown ups from opposing clans
honoring the push and pull i should have called the scholomance
oh well preservation is a doozie
will you be needing another appointment “ absolutely
im shrunk
