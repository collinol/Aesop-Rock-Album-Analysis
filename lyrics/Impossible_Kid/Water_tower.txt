vita est morte est vita
life is death is life
found nothing but the feathers and the skull
on the porch like a present with a bow
denizen of black earth gutted and uncoupled from the patchwork
buried by a 7 year cherub in the backyard
epitaph and all
disciple of the cycles and sciences of birth into fertilized hyacinth
life into vitamins invited up to cypresses
a testament to moxie and the miracle of lifelessness
its tricky when youd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient
than navigate this mortal coil in human skin dig
the nuances of putrefying jelly hit the levee
when those feathers are a cancer in your bestie
and i pick a ginger gold as fed by a drunken uncle
one from a customer pumping that sumner blood work
memitim ascending settling any high scores
40 meters up with the heart of a high dive horse
paint no rules on the water tower x4
impossible impossible
hold the fuck up
who is you talking to
cause aint nobody talking to you
you cant do a motherfucking thing
i told my ex in 97 i was falling on my weapon
ripped the phone up out the wall
the po would drag me from my bedroom
an embarrassing ordeal involving hospitals and questions
and the kind of doctors who use words like cognitive and spectrum
while explaining why youre selfish to romanticize a ruse
in which unruly roots pull you to lucifer by your shoes i mean it isnt perfect but dont misconstrue the purpose
any urge is indiscernible from community service to the kiddo
plus shed make a beautiful widow
but thats an altruistic ticket to a room with no windows
hmm youd think he wouldve learned back in the 80s
when they pulled him out of class over concerns about his safety
but he didnt it wasnt cause he doesnt get the message
more he doesnt judge a man by how honorable his death is
on a scale you made up anyway
half past out to pasture
whether clapped or batteries in backwards
check this shit out here
dont be trying to come all for me
cause you is not all of that with your fucked up haircut
i had a pet lizard he never got an obit
fed him crickets it was dead a fucking month before i noticed
an older me would note that whether disposable goldfish
or theist we certainly become the earth as equals in a circle
unique until the spirit isnt willing
while the flesh is still a staple of the labor force and whistling
its roadkill evoking emotion his own totem dont
thats a reality you evade or grow to own
social code broke and a hierarchy to gasp at
black labs over wack dads on the admat
tabby over parasite bats at the parish
a civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms
im born from the guts of stars and black tar pits
iron maiden denim paint the devil under grawlix
crawls out a clawed coffin to huff and puff
somewhere in between the dust and dust
