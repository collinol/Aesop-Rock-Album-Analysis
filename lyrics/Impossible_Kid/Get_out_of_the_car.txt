i see how yall be trying to front man yall be fronting man
been a bit since mu died
been a lot more loss in the wake
i recall thinking someday
someones gonna say its all from the same cause and effect
and i just couldnt fathom
blaming a whole new page on a made up chain reaction
each claim individual peaks and pockets
pains and a slew of unique nuances
nahmean when you wake up 8 years non responsive
its a lot to process
gone from a happier jack in the box
to a package of clogged up chakras
oh shazbat not the ever after he wanted
from the once upon a time dot dot dot
once upon a time he was so much more
than a punchline for his own potshots
ah watch the impossible kid
everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
if i zoom on out i can finally admit
its all been a blur since mu got sick
none of the subsequent years stood a chance
whether you his moms or his mans
whether you his pops or his girl
i was poison heart full of canines head full of voices
whole life trying to quiet em down
like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
hounds at bay but they just wont stay
true friendship in a tugboat way
a go dark in the face of the fucked
when the fucked was a friend i was basically done
into the woods go his alien tongue
it was that or a textbook faking of funk and i cant
here go the hindsight
8 years been one long blindside
i could pinpoint 7 more turns that occurred
cause he never really healed from the first
oh what a world any hack is a myth
any dap is a joke any map is a trick
any graph is a hoax ease on down
im burning up im bleeding out
knowing aint half the battle
thats a bullshit quip written by some asshole
you can own what you are
and still sit around stoned in your car
not doing shit halfway to nil
cranky and waiting for a boss key and hat full of bills
get out the car aes
