spoilers the non bon voyage
stock weaponry and soylents and whatever stop the voices
colossal paranoias out to author an abrasive lore
about how war paint wont assure you aint a painted whore baby
no ground wires all jaw froth
mouth breathing outliers climb out of mothballs
wrung stones unsung and alone
known to run up in the unknown honey im home
i push a bucket of bolts assorted death in his wake
i take the hand off the thief i take the head off a snake
approach a pen like revolutions just a sentence away
til then hes documenting cops and watching heaven decay
its not a gentlemans game its a generation braced accordingly
who know the differences between the cozy and the quarantine
yes yall the crestfallen careworn
air horn air horn air horn air horn
these awful winds
those grinding gears
this pile of bones
thats why im here
wild frontier
come on
these violent drums
those primal fears
this pool of mud
thats why im here
w w w w wild frontier
thats impossible body still warm
scavengers already obsessively knocking on his molecules
im catatonic fat and outta rocket fuel and ramen
not a dollar watching rocky 2 in donatello boxers
at some hot as hell motel in whats supposed to be his shangri la
more akin to angry mobs with anchor tats and mangey dogs in vacant lots
traded any semblance of consistency to play the odds
not even a baby doll to change his gauze
not even a hideaway to hide up in
a side effect of sliding environment to environment
driving isnt simply when the tires spin try again
departures and arrivals arent only time and mileage
try again again a raider break off from the phalanx
and never look back never cook crack k   thanks bye
new york in the rear view then peel
out til he found new york in the windshield
these cursed dogs
those flying spears
this rancid food
thats why im here
wild frontier
come on
these fleeting hopes
those vital prayers
this bag of cash
thats why im here
w w w w wild frontier
this was never an effective way to rally insurgents
or really even the occupation of a rational person
when you write about seclusion and some buyers finally tune in
you get frightened finding happiness can drive away the movement
in a jiffy just eat your food and keep the future iffy
that fruitions for the viewers who need a loser to pity
plus an underlying message of a greater disconnection
god forbid he try to live or gain momentum
mend or pay his penance
youd rather see him eat a bowl of mouse traps
surf a thousand couches
take a jagged little down the hatch
chowderheads
i know you love the way the failure flounder
maybe i could be your daily downer
if his brain left his body and was headed for the door
would you take it in and help it find its way into a jar
no fuck it let him hop around a maze
we can see whos really lost when the schadenfreude fades
these churning seas
those quiet sneers
this box of parts
thats why im here
wild frontier
come on
these creepy friends
those dicey dares
this perfect dark
thats why im here
w w w w wild frontier
