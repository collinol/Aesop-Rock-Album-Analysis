yep steps up to the plate
little brother little league 87 he was 8
rookie season for the skinny slugger newly out of t ball
pit against a pitcher with a ripper you could eat off
church then a grip of loons run to 3rd first
granny yelling go cubs nose in her word search
seen milfs like apes on a monolithic bleacher
into advocating war and peace in lieu of sport and leisure
hi peggie i was 10 chewing on a sweet tart
little brother left field queens guard mean arm
knees bent 2 out 2 on bags
when i caught him staring down at something moving through the grass
hold up tagged runner and the whole cast rotate
not before he could identify the culprit
granny yelling go cubs graham yelling gopher
new left fielder give a fuck about a homer
got a homie little rodent head and shoulders out his hovel
no baseball in the bubble ruh roh
parents thought it adorable the players followed suit
inning crawling to a close head coach not amused
coach seeing red coach on the diamond
dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him
when he transverse 3rd the families turn nervous
the following is a transcript of man vs vermin
here we go man stands out by a hole
pest pops up to patrol
man plays live whac a mole
in a scene that would try every child as adults
whoa pallbearer with a ball mitt
thrown over the fence coach hit the bench
both teams lose good game good game
granny yelling go cubs cubs aint playing
my little brother is a funny dude
a lot of funny shit happened to him
my other brother pretty funny too
aint seen him in a minute though
just in case of rough waters i want to put one up for my brothers
just in case of rough waters i want to put one up for my brothers
yep not a part of the machine
big brother big idea 9 0 16
neubaten tee plaid flannel laden adolescent art kid
tony hawk hair skinny puppy denim
and a record player vomiting alien sex fiend
peel sessions in a christian home for field testing
its real youth in the palm of your hand
when your mom thinks satan is involved in a band
we were buried in the village voice checking who was playing where
pulled his head up out the paper pushing out a single tear
5 words like a beacon of light in the mist ministry live at the ritz
it was christ has risen to chris 3 loaves 2 fish
miracle of mechanized loops on 2 inch
coming to a theater he would be there in the flesh
moms didnt say no but she didnt say yes
cop tickets ah the plot thickens
countdown to ultimate concert experience
ma still wary and why are they called ministry
are they a cult maybe she would properly investigate
bought a mag with an al jourgensen interview
read a couple sentences glanced at a pic or two or three
thats all no fair trial
simply you will not be going to the show and thats final
what occurred next were the top of the lungs
of a son who unjustly had lost what he loved
in a moment that would transcend anger to high art
said this is something i am willing to die for
can you even imagine a death in the fam from industrial fandom
anyway no body count no concert
and chris kicked rocks in his mismatched converse
my older brother is a funny dude
a lot of funny shit happened to him
we hadnt spoken in a couple moons
i called him last night how you doing
just in case of rough waters i want to put one up for my brothers
just in case of rough waters i want to put one up for my brothers
